Python Collection Pipeline
==========================

Today I enabled Travis CI builds for collection pipelines project:
https://travis-ci.org/povilasb/pycollection-pipelines.

I fixed `words` processor to split text into words that are separated by
punctuation marks.

Also, I wrote some type annotations: https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html.
