HackerRank Challenge
====================

Today I finally fixed the bugs, got the naive implementation working.
Although it timed out most of the test cases.

Eventually, I implemented the "Rubber Banding" algorithm by Charley Lewittes.
I got one more test case to pass, but the rest still timed out.

Unix & Linux Debugging Tools
----------------------------

Pris Nasrat presented some of useful Linux tools:

* strace
* lsof
* gdb
* /proc filesystem
* etc

All of the tools I knew before.
But some of the options of lsof, strace, etc. were new for me :)

Linux Kernel Seminar
--------------------

I really enjoyed this talk.

Sarah Sharp introduced us to the Linux kernel development process.
She overviewed the compilation, source code tree, demonstrated how
one of the usb devices sources looks like, etc.
