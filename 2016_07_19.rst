PyFNV
=====

Today I rolled out a new `PyFNV <https://github.com/povilasb/pyfnv>`_ version
(0.2.0).
The hashing function was updated to work with byte buffers rather than
string ones.
Also, annotated code with types.

PyQUIC
======

Today I implemented a QUIC packet hash calculation.
Then this calculated hash can be compared with the one in packet itself to
check the packet integrity.
