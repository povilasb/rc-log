Today I spent my whole day tracking were the package I sent to Lithuania
got lost.

I was suprised to see the package bouncind aroung Poland and Lithuania.
So I started questioning USPS what is going on.

I wrote an email to USPS, did not receive an anwser shortly.
So I went to local post office just to get the answer "we don't know".
They advised me to contact Lithuanian post office.
So I did and I received the very same answer "we don't know, haven't received the item".
Eventually I wrote emails to everyone: Lithuanian customs, post office,
USPS and Polish post office.

Eventually, I received an email from USPS telling me that their system shows
new package status "delivered to Postal Agent on 08/03/2016 in Vilnius, Lithuania".
Although I could not see that on
`public USPS tracking system <https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction.action?tRef=fullpage&tLc=1&tLabels=EZ038287878US>`_.

So I'm waiting till next day to see if they actually found the package or not.
