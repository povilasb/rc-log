PyQUIC
======

Today I finished implementing stream frame header parsing.

Misc
====

Also I helped Amulya with networking problems on her freshly installed
Ubuntu 16.04.

Then Antony implemented https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm
and he was interested how I would solve that.
So I did it :)

.. code-block:: python

    def ensure_max_9(digit):
        if digit > 9:
            return digit - 9
        return digit

    def is_credit_card_number_valid(card_number):
        digits = [int(d) for d in card_number[::2]]
        doubled = [ensure_max_9(int(d) * 2) for d in card_number[1::2]]
        return (sum(digits) + sum(doubled)) % 10 == 0

    assert is_credit_card_number_valid('79927398713') == True
