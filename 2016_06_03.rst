QUIC Research
=============

Today I tried to understand the first client packet with `CHLO` (Client Hello)
tag. There was one undocumented 16 byte field that I could not understand.
This field was just after the public packet and before the `CHLO` tag.
The value of this field was different for every request.

I dug into `proto-quic` sources to find the answer.
It took me almost a day.
And unfortunately I did not find the answer.
At the end of the day I posted a question on Google Groups
https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/proto-quic/2T8QB6p3kIg.

Turns out that this field is a packet hash.
And the hash function is `FNV1a
