Today I finally hunted down and solved the "Missing kFIXD" problem.
There were 2 problems.

The first problem was missing `COPT` tag with value `FIXD`.
Unfortunately it was not documented.

Then when I added this tag it still would not work.
After debugging session I found out that although the tags were serialized
in a correct order, the tag values were out of order.
So the `COPT` tag had a wrong value.
Eventually, I fixed the `tags.Container.values()` to return items in the
same order as tag names.

Then I received another error message "Unable to read frame data".
After some debugging I found out the the `CHLO` message body must be minimum
1024 bytes length.
Which I think is also undocumented.
