QUIC Research
=============

I tried to validate if the extracted
`fnv hashing utilities <https://github.com/povilasb/cpp-fnv>`_ work as they
are expected.
Before I could do that I had to figure out which data is passed to the hashing
function.
Turns out that there are two blobs of data: the public header and the packet
payload.
Using `quic-proto` sample `quic_client` I saved locally the public header,
CHLO packet payload and the computed hash.
Then I used this data to validate if `cpp-fnv` utilities calculate
a proper hash for the given values.
Successfully it did it right :)


Events
======

I attended the Flask workshop for the beginners.
It's a lightweight python based Web development framework.
I've used Flask before for the basic needs.
So I knew most of the presented information: basic Flask samples, Jinja
template use, etc.
