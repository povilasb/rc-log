PyQUIC
======

I finished implementing CHLO message serialization.
Then I built a prototype to build a whole QUIC CHLO packet which included
public header, packet hash, stream frame header and CHLO message body.

When trying to send the packet with nc (`cat chlo.raw | nc -u 172.17.0.2 80`)
I would receive "No recent network activity" error response from the server.
I started digging into `proto-quic` source code to find out what this error
message really means.
It turns out that it's the connection timeout error.
But that was the first packet for that connection.
So this made me no sense.
Then investigating the sample packet sent by demo QUIC client I noticed it
had `CTIM` (client timestamp) tag.
I did not include this tag into my packet. So my first thought was that
the lack of this tag might result in connection timeout.
So I tried to add this tag.
But unfortunately it didn't help.

Then it was time to run `gdb` in order to find out what triggers this error.
Eventually I just played around with `gdb` but this research must be continued
later.
