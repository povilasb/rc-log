HackerRank challenge
====================

Last week I participated in a coding dojo. We worked on a HackerRank challenge
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/bear-and-steady-gene.
Unfortunately, I could not make my it work then.
The problem didn't seem too hard and it bugged me.
So I decided to solve it.

I reimplemented it in python again.
Naive implementation only passed 2 test cases and the rest of them timedout.
Therefore I will have to profile and optimize my solution.
