Machine learning
================

Today I started my machine learning studies week.
I started with face recognition. I
want to build a sample application to recognize myself from the picture.

I knew Antony solved this problem earlier.
So I investigated his implementation and successfully ran the demo from
https://github.com/antonyross/eigenfaces.

Then I read about how that actually works - eigenfaces method.
It builds vectors for every face image, calculates the mean image,
uses PCA to reduce the vector size.
Then to detect a given face image, it calculates euclidien distance for every
trained image. The face that has the closest distance is the answer.

Android app
===========

In the evening I tried to build hello world android application with Kotlin.
I figured that was too much hassle. So I attempted to build one with java.
But I still failed. There was something wrong with android SDK version
compatibility.
