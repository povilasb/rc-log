Machine learning
================

Today I took several images of myself.
I processed them to work with eigenfaces algorithm: cut the face,
made them grayscale and scaled to 100 by 100.

Then I tested if the algorithm can recognize me in new photos.
And it did :)

Misc
====

I also helped Amulya with Linux installation.
She was setuping her developing environment on Ubuntu.
She installed various machine learning frameworks, libraries and tools.
We created an `install.sh` script to automate every step.
