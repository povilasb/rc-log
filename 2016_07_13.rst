QUIC CHLO packet
================

Today I replaced loops with collection pipelines.
I used https://github.com/EntilZha/PyFunctional library.

Vagrant
=======

Also I helped Amulya to setup scikitlearn and Tesnsorflow vagrant image.

Machine Learning Seminar
========================

Later I attended intro to machine learning seminar by Antony.
He explained theory starting from the very basics: linear regression,
what is weights, backpropagation.
He introduced us with multiple linear regression, neural networks, deep neural
networks, etc.

Python Collection Pipelines
===========================

In the evening I implemented collection pipelines output processor **pysay**.
It prints text items using this kind of format::

      _______
    < My text >
      -------
        \
         \
             .-----.
            | O     |
            +---.   |
            ____|   |
          +         . .--.
         |   .-----+  |   |
         |   | .-----+    |
          +-+ /    ______.+
              |   |
              |   +---.
              \     O |
               +-----+
