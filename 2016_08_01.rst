Today I reviewed Amulya's code.
She implemented `bash brace expansion <http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_03_04.html>`_.
I was trying to solve this problem recursively because I thought the code
would be wayt shorter.
But I did not come up with the working implementation and I proceeded with
QUIC CHLO package research.
