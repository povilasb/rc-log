Events
======

I attended the neural networks workshop.

WIFI Troubles
=============

I still had issues with WIFI.
Installed `wicd` on my Debian.
For now it seems to work :)

Chromium code base
==================

Almost for a whole day I worked on compiling QUIC demo server which was inside
Chromium repo.
Unfortunately I couldn't get it working.

Later accidentially I found Jim Roskind's tweet about Google open sourcing
stand alone QUIC library https://github.com/google/proto-quic.
Basically it's the same as https://github.com/devsisters/libquic but it
has demo server and client included.

Eventually I ended up compiling the demo server at the end of the day.
