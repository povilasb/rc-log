QUIC Demo Server
================

Finally I finished building the Docker image for demo QUIC server
https://github.com/povilasb/docker-demo-quic-server.

And posted the results on Google groups
https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!searchin/proto-quic/docker/proto-quic/Nqyx8r-W_bs/NE3-Q8EaAQAJ

QUIC Version Detector
=====================

During the second part of the day I was working on a tool that detects
which QUIC protocol versions are supported by a given server.

At the end of the day I had a working rough prototype.
It's implemented in python3.
