Python Collection Pipeline
==========================

Today I added json processor, some tests, updated
`CollectionPipelineProcessor.process()` to be more testable.
Now it accepts an item instead of getting one from `yield`.

.. code-block:: python

    def process(self, item):

I had some troubles mocking one of my functions with `mock.patch()`.
So I spent some time investigating that.
But eventually I just made the function part of `http` processor class and
mocked it in a usual way.

.. code-block:: python

    class http(CollectionPipelineProcessor):

        def _get(self, url):
            """
            Returns:
                str: response body.
            """
            return urllib.request.urlopen(url).read().decode('utf-8')

Though it does not use the `self` reference.
