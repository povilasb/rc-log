Intro To Machine Learning
=========================

While studying in Recurse Center I'm seeing a lot of people doing very
fun stuff with Machine Learning.
So I told myself I'm going to allocate some time for ML.
I thought of doing this on the weekends so that it would not interfere
with my main work: QUIC protocol research.

Today I simply played with http://scikit-learn.org/.
I did some exercises from
`Google Machine Learning Recipes series <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal>`_.

That was fun and easy using the framework.
I only needed less than 10 lines of code to get my basic examples working and
to start predicting and classifying data :)

But I can see that some things can get complicated pretty fast.
