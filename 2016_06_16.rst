Binding C++ With Python
=======================

Today I was helping out Anna Kedzierska with some C++.
She was struggling with building the C++ bindings for Python.

I was planning to play around with the same problem some time.
So there I had an opportunity to do that while helping someone :)

Initially Anna tried to use Boost Python binding library.
But I remembed a better alternative to it called
`pybind11 <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11>`_.
It's a header only C++11 compatible library.
So I played around with the library and ended up with very simple example
https://github.com/povilasb/pybind-samples.

Anna was using Mac OS X. So we needed to adjust some slight details.
But eventually the samples worked for her too :)
