QUIC Version Detector
=====================

Today I worked on refactor QUIC version detector tool.
I was trying to make UDP requests asynchronously with python `asyncio`.
`asyncio` was not as intuitive as I expected.
I'm comming from a backround where I used to work with `libevent`.
`asyncio` uses python facilities like futures, tasks, coroutines, etc.
that I'm not familiar with yet.
So in order to understand how `asyncio` actually works, I should
get myself comfortable with the basics of those features.

Anyways, eventually I managed to make a working prototype.
But it still requires some polishing, implementing timeouts, request bursts,
tests, etc.
