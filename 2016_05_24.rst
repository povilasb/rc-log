Day 2

WIFI debugging
==============

I had some WIFI issues.
The connection would just randomly drop.

Played with `iwlwifi` driver.
Tried to disable some features to get it working.

Chromium repo
=============

I got my hands on chromium git repository.
Tried to compile and run the sample QUIC server and client which are inside
chromium repository.
My first attempts were unsuccessful.
