Python Coroutines
=================

Today I was playing around with Python coroutines and generators.
I ended up build a collection pipeline library.
E.g. I could do something like this in python syntax

.. code-block:: python

    cat('/tmp/file.txt') | filter('some line') | filter('some line 2') | out

Just imagine how cool and easy it would be to prototype with something like
this in my `xonsh`::

    $ scrape('google.com/search?q=python') | css('#ires') | css('a["href"]') | filter('*.org') | sort() | out()
