Python FNV hash library
=======================

Today I worked a bit more on the FNV hash functions
(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fnv).
I wanted to publish it as a separate library.
So I made it a little more flexible.
One can specify hash size in bits and which algorithm to use: either FNV or
FNV-1A.

Finally I published it on pypi https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fnv.
