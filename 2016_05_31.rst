Bluetooth issues
================

For some reasons my Bluetooth device just stopped working today.
At first I thought it was a software problem.

I checked if Bluetooth software stack was loaded::

    ➜  ~ dmesg | grep Blue
    [   33.465517] Bluetooth: Core ver 2.19
    [   33.465544] Bluetooth: HCI device and connection manager initialized
    [   33.465551] Bluetooth: HCI socket layer initialized
    [   33.465554] Bluetooth: L2CAP socket layer initialized
    [   33.465565] Bluetooth: SCO socket layer initialized
    [   33.475025] Bluetooth: BNEP (Ethernet Emulation) ver 1.3
    [   33.475030] Bluetooth: BNEP filters: protocol multicast
    [   33.475040] Bluetooth: BNEP socket layer initialized

Then I checked if the device is not blocked::

    ➜  ~ rfkill list all
    0: phy0: Wireless LAN
            Soft blocked: no
            Hard blocked: no

And the device was not listed in here. So I listed all PCI devices::

    ➜  ~ lspci
    00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family DRAM Controller (rev 09)
    00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)
    00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family MEI Controller #1 (rev 04)
    00:19.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82579LM Gigabit Network Connection (rev 04)
    00:1a.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #2 (rev 04)
    00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family High Definition Audio Controller (rev 04)
    00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 1 (rev b4)
    00:1c.1 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 2 (rev b4)
    00:1c.3 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 4 (rev b4)
    00:1c.4 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 5 (rev b4)
    00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #1 (rev 04)
    00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation QM67 Express Chipset Family LPC Controller (rev 04)
    00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family 6 port SATA AHCI Controller (rev 04)
    00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family SMBus Controller (rev 04)
    03:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation Centrino Wireless-N 1000 [Condor Peak]
    0d:00.0 System peripheral: Ricoh Co Ltd PCIe SDXC/MMC Host Controller (rev 07)

I couldn't find the Bluetooth listed in here either.
So I presumed this is a hardware issue.

QUIC Version Detector
=====================

I finished the QUIC version detection tool to print a nicer output.
You can see the demo at https://github.com/povilasb/quic-version-detector.

Published the packed on PyPI https://pypi.python.org/pypi/quic-version-detector/0.1.1.

Tools
=====

I've got familiar with https://github.com/icholy/ttygif: a really easy utility
to record your terminal into a gif file.

Events
======

At the end of the day I went to NYC Linux User Group meetup.
They held an open hacker hours event.
It was a workshop like event. You could work on anything you wanted.
I was planning to work on VPN over DNS.
Unfortunately, there was no available internet connection.
So I didn't stay there long...
