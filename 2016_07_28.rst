PyQUIC

Today I ran into another problem.
I would receive "tags out of order" error message.
After doing to testing it was clear that the tag order was not correct.
Then I reread the crypto document. And then it was clear that tags (SNI, VER,
etc.) are converted to 32 bit integers and ordered in ascending order
before serializing.

So I started working on tags container class that is a dictionary that
implements these requirements.
