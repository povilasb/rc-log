Soundex algorithm
=================

Me and Charlie paired up to implement `the Soundex algorithm
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex>`_.

We chose to do two implementations: one in java and another one in python.

Today we only implemented it in java.
The algorithm is easy.
But we both agreed that we should invest more time in researching
java 8 streams :)
