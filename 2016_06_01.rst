QUIC Research
=============

At the start of my work day I reviewed Wireshark QUIC dissector code
(http://code.metager.de/source/xref/wireshark/epan/dissectors/packet-quic.c).
My main goal was to make a regular HTTP GET request.
But this Wireshark dissector only parsed the public header.
So I did not find anything interesting in there.

Later I started doing some research on the QUIC crypto protocol.
I read the handshake part of the QUIC crypto protocol.
Investigated the communication between demo server and client using
Wireshark.

Events
======

Attended the "Public key encryption/SSL seminar".
Most of the information I already knew.
Although I put together some missing pieces of the puzzle related to
certificate authorities.
