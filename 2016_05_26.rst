QUIC Demo Server
================

First hall of the day I was trying to run the server.
The main problem was generating proper certificates.
Eventually, I've found a script in chromium repo that does that for you
(`net/tools/quic/certs/generate-certs.sh`).

When I had the certificates, I was able to run the QUIC server.
But I faced another problem: the demo QUIC client just would not validate
the self signed certificate.
Chromium has some info on how to trust the self signed certificates:
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/linux_cert_management.md
But this did not work for me.

So eventually I ended up patching the client code which validates the certificate.
That was a one liner patch, which just ignored the checks :)
So this hack let me got further.

Finally, I started building a Docker image for the server...
