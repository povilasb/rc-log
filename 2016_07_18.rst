Docker autostart
================

Recently I got tired of constantly starting my QUIC demo server docker
container every time I restart computer.
So I decided to look up how to autostart docker containers.

Turns out it's really easy to do so.
Docker has restart policy built-in
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#restart-policies-restart.

All I had to do was to appen **--restart=always** flag to **docker run**
command.

PyQUIC
======

Today I refactored code a little bit and implemented packet hash extraction.

Events
======

Today I attended two events.
The first one was big data developers meetup. Developer from IBM presented
how to do basketball game predictions using spark and some machine learning.

The next one was at Ebay office. One of Recurse Center residents presented
about web security: how cookies and other meta information sent by browser
can expose your visited websites, etc.
