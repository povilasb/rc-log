PyQUIC
======

Today I spent considerable amount of time debugging `proto-quic` source
code with gdb.
Finally, I found out what caused "No recent network activity" error.
My packet had bad hash.
The padding bytes were not included into the hash calculation.

I would expect QUIC server to return proper error message, but in this case
it would only tell me that the message timed out.
Although, I was not using the latest version.
I was using 4cc12d2679be1baceb162a7fde89b7183901fe84 (2016-07-12) version.

Machine Learning
================

In the evening I continued working on my small machine learning problem:
train model with labeled x;y coordinates and then classify new given
coordinates.

So today I built a scikit-learn docker image
https://hub.docker.com/r/povilasb/scikit-learn/.
I also split the code to visualization and classification modules.
