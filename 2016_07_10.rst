Databases camp
==============

It's a free conference about databases (http://database.camp/).
I enjoyed the talk about `ScyllaDB <http://www.scylladb.com/>`_ the most.

It's a Cassandra compatible database but 10 times faster.
It's written in C++ and has a lot of very interesting optimizations.
These guys wrote their own user space TCP/IP stack, disk I/O scheduler, etc.
