HackerRank Challenge
====================

When I finished with my own implementation, I still spent some time looking
at `Charley's implementation in Scala <https://github.com/ctlewitt/Scala-Practice/blob/master/src/BearAndSteadyGene.scala>`_.
It was short and neat.
So I decided to refactor mine too.

After I investigated Charley's code it was clear why this implementation
was way shorted. It used recursion.
So I decided to do that myself.
Turns out that python limits recursion depth. And I hit the limit
with the larger test cases.
Unfortunately python does not have a tail recursion optimization.
So I just dropped the idea of implementing the algorithm in python the
same way Charley did.

At the end of the day I just played with other hacker rank python problems.
